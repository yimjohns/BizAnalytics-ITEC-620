The folder structure to locate the dataset is given below: 

***BizAnalytics > assignments > 08 > Dataset***

The dataset named ***Camry.csv*** contains two variables - Miles and Price.
The goal is to fit a simple linear regression model to predict Price given Mile.
***E(y) = b0 + b1x*** where *y* is the independent (Response) variable - Price, 
*b0* is the *intercept*, *b1* is the *co-efficient* of the independent (Predictor) variable x - *Miles*

### Load library
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Read the file
```{r}

camry = read_csv("../docs/dataset/08/Camry.csv", show_col_types = F)

```


### Fit the linear model
```{r}
camry.SLRModel <- lm(Price ~ Miles, camry)
```


### Derive the summary
```{r}
summary(camry.SLRModel)
```
